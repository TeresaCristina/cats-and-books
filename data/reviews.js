The author brought forth the perspective of a woman who comes from a very restrictive society in a very interesting and impressive way (especially if you consider the fact that he is a man). Besides that, I liked the plot idea and I think it was very well developed. My only problem was the ending, it made no sense with everything that was happening until that point (maybe if the author had finished the story some pages before that wouldn't have been a problem).",

Unfortunately, the author had a good idea, but her execution of it wasn't the best. The protagonist's reasons throughout the story felt shallow, with her path not making any sense at all in the end (at least not in the deep way the author was trying to convey).I learned a lit bit about Albania, though.",
